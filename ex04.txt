Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances
of the Eq class? When is it feasible? Hint: two functions of the same
type are equal if they always return equal results for equal arguments.

Because a function type has a set of values that correspond its domain and
the range of values associated for each input. In order to define equality,
it would be necessary that this property is identical for two given functions.
Which is something hard to determine.

It would be feasible on code automated tests, so for example, you could do:

mySortFunc == quickSort

Which just input random values and then check that boths outputs the same
values.
