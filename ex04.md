A function type has a set of values that correspond its domain and
the range of values associated for each input. In order to define equality,
it would be necessary that this property is identical for two given functions.
Which is something hard to determine.

So, the domain o value might be infinity, so in order to check the equality it
would require to test over a infinity set of values, this is why it is not
feasible to add `Eq` for functions. However, if the input set is limited, like
Bool that has 2 values, it would be feasible to define equality.
